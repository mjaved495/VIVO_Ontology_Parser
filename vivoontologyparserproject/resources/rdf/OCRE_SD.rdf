A study in which an individual acts has his/her own comparison does not fall into this category, since an individual is not a group.</j.0:IAO_0000115>

    <j.0:IAO_0000115>Phase describes the level of a trial required of drugs before (and after) they are routinely used in clinical practice: 
- Phase I trials assess toxic effects on humans (not many people participate in them, and usually without controls); 
- Phase ll trials assess therapeutic benefit (usually involving a few hundred people, usually with controls, but not always); 
- Phase III trials compare the new treatment against standard (or placebo) treatment (usually a full randomised controlled trial). At this point, a drug can be approved for community use. 
- Phase IV monitors a new treatment in the community, often to evaluate longterm safety and effectiveness. [Glossary of Terms in The Cochrane Collaboration]

A trial can be of a combination phase (e.g., I/II).
The concept of phase is not applicable to trials studying certain interventions (e.g., device, procedure, behavioral)</j.0:IAO_0000115>
